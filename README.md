My extended frontend version of the "Wallet" application, which was originally created by a great team where I served as a Team Lead: https://github.com/Pawel-Eliszewski/WalletApp-frontend

===
Currently, I am working on expanding it with additional features:

- Upgrade to a Progressive Web App (for both mobile and desktop platforms);
- Enhance accessibility, for example, ensuring navigation is possible using only a keyboard;
- Refactor from CSS Modules to BEM & Sass;
- Implement a new project structure and refactor the majority of components;
- Provide Dark/Light Color Schemes;
- Include a Search Form with transaction filters (amount, date, type, category, comment);
- Display 5 consecutive currencies in the Currency component;
- Utilize Framer-Motion for modal animations;
- Use React-Select for dropdowns;
- Offer Polish and English language versions for users to choose from (work in progress);
- Implement Google authorization (work in progress);
- Introduce new chart types for the StatisticsTab (work in progress);
