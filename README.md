My extended frontend version of the "Wallet" application, which was originally created by a great team where I served as a Team Lead: https://github.com/Pawel-Eliszewski/WalletApp-frontend

===
Currently, I am working on expanding it with additional features:

- Upgrade to Progressive Web App (mobile & desktop);
- Accessibility (f.e., navigation with only a keyboard);
- Refactor from css.modules to BEM & Sass;
- Implementing a new project structure and refactoring the majority of components;
- Dark/Light Color Schemes;
- Polish and English language versions to choose from;
- Searach Form with transactions filters (amount, date, type, category, comment);
- 5 consecutive currencies in the Currency component;
- Google authorization;
- New StatisticsTab chart types;
- Framer-Motion for Modal animations;
- React-Select for Dropdown;
